## About me

![portfolio picture](assets/portfolio_picture.png){:width="250px"}

I offer English to Romanian translation, subtitling, proofreading and audio transcription services. I am native in Romanian and advanced in English (C1).

I love translation, so much so that I have translated **more than 100 articles** on Global Voices as a volunteer. Translation is a true passion for me. As a social scientist I love texts exposing social problems and texts describing protests.

My areas of expertise are:
-  academic translation in social sciences
-  journalism ([see my Global Voices profile](https://ro.globalvoices.org/author/ioana-dobre))
-  education  ([see my TED profile](https://www.ted.com/profiles/36332057/translator) and [my Wikipedia profile](https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilizator:Ioana2022))

I am well organized, self driven, reliable and I have experience in working remotely. As a professional, I'm proficient in the following software:
- Microsoft Word
- OmegaT, Phrase (for translating)
- Subtitle Edit, CaptionHub (for subtitling)
- ExpressScribe (for transcribing)

## Testimonials

Proofreading:

*“I am very pleased with the quality of work and the level of textual engagement with my manuscript done by Ioana Dobre. She provided meticulous proofing and spotted what would have otherwise been rather embarrassing typos and other grammatical mistakes after publishing. Academic researchers need such committed professional proofreaders, whose services allow them to focus entirely on the content of their work. Ioana is definitely such a reliable professional.”*

Interview transcription:

*“Ioana was one of the few brilliant students of my class of Classical Sociology Theory at university. After a while, I was very happy that she responded positively to my invitation to perform work as a research assistant within a national research project focused on international migration and entrepreneurship. She perfectly understood the requirements of social research activity and managed to provide high quality transcription for in-depth interviews. She was able to prioritize tasks, worked laboriously and always respected deadlines. Certainly, I would recommend her for future projects.”*
