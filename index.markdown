## About me

![portfolio picture](assets/portfolio_picture.png){:width="250px"}

I offer English to Romanian translation, subtitling, proofreading and audio transcription services. I am native in Romanian and advanced in English (C1). I love making English content available to the general public be it of an educational, cultural or social nature.

## My areas of expertise:

-  academic translation in social sciences (as a sociology graduate I have been entrusted by academics with translating research papers)
-  mass media content with an accent on the sociopolitical and cultural domain ([see my Global Voices profile](https://ro.globalvoices.org/author/ioana-dobre))
-  education (see my profiles on [TED](https://www.ted.com/profiles/36332057/translator), [Wikipedia](https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilizator:Ioana2022), and [TWB](https://twbplatform.org/5142706f6861514b4d74734c5a4a724b5734626e36413d3d3a3a4c9109a439962832a0270f1d0c149686/key/))
-  communications to the public (emails to clients, product descriptions)

## Testimonials

Proofreading:

*“I am very pleased with the quality of work and the level of textual engagement with my manuscript done by Ioana Dobre. She provided meticulous proofing and spotted what would have otherwise been rather embarrassing typos and other grammatical mistakes after publishing. Academic researchers need such committed professional proofreaders, whose services allow them to focus entirely on the content of their work. Ioana is definitely such a reliable professional.”*

Interview transcription:

*“Ioana was one of the few brilliant students of my class of Classical Sociology Theory at university. After a while, I was very happy that she responded positively to my invitation to perform work as a research assistant within a national research project focused on international migration and entrepreneurship. She perfectly understood the requirements of social research activity and managed to provide high quality transcription for in-depth interviews. She was able to prioritize tasks, worked laboriously and always respected deadlines. Certainly, I would recommend her for future projects.”*
